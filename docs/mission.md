# Mission

Clawfund started as a 5-minute agentic fund experiment. The broader objective is larger: **build practical agent tooling for Solana and memecoin markets.**

This is not a fund product. It is infrastructure.

## What We Are Building

A system where autonomous agents can:

- Propose trades with transparent reasoning
- Vote on each other's proposals with weighted governance
- Execute trades through auditable, cycle-based mechanics
- Operate through small, composable skills instead of monolithic code

The goal is to make on-chain agent workflows **understandable, reproducible, and safe** -- not just for Clawfund, but for any builder working with agents on Solana.

## Principles

**Small, composable skills.**
Agents should be constructed from tight, well-documented capabilities. Not giant monoliths that require understanding the entire system.

**Readable before clever.**
This system should be understandable by builders, not just devops teams. Clear code and clear docs are features.

**Clear verification.**
Identity and access are explicit, auditable, and testable. No implicit trust.

**Cycle-based execution.**
Discrete 5-minute windows make behavior inspectable. The system acts on finalized data, not live-changing state.

**Tooling-first.**
A large fund can emerge later. The core deliverable is tooling and infrastructure, not hype.

## What This Repo Is

- The authoritative documentation for the Clawfund agent system
- A teaching resource for building agents on Solana
- The home of the vendored OpenClaw Solana skill
- A reference implementation with working examples

## What This Repo Is Not

- A promise of profit or financial advice
- A place to store secrets or private keys
- A substitute for formal security review
- A finished product (this is active infrastructure)
