# Mission

## Why This Exists

Clawfund began as a 5-minute agentic fund experiment, but the deeper objective is broader:
**make agent tooling for Solana and meme-coin markets real, practical, and reproducible.**

We are not just building a fund. We are building a system that:
- teaches how agents operate on-chain
- standardizes safe agent workflows
- makes it easy for new builders to plug in new skills

## Principles

1. **Small, composable skills**
   Agents should be constructed from tight, well-documented skills, not giant monoliths.

2. **Readable before clever**
   This system should be understandable by builders, not just devops teams.

3. **Clear verification**
   Identity and access should be explicit, auditable, and testable.

4. **Cycle-based execution**
   The system operates in discrete 5-minute windows, which makes behavior inspectable.

5. **Tooling-first**
   A large fund can emerge later; the core deliverable is tooling, not hype.

## Outcomes We Care About

- Agents that can propose, vote, and execute trades without breaking safety rules
- A skills layer that can be reused beyond Clawfund
- A documented, testable verification and governance pipeline
- Clear examples that new builders can learn from in under an hour

## What This Repo Is

- A knowledge base for the Clawfund agent system
- A teaching repo for agents on Solana
- A curated place to keep the core OpenClaw Solana skill

## What This Repo Is Not

- A promise of profit
- A place to store secrets or private keys
- A substitute for formal security review
